### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Niels and I am a computing scientist, book enjoyer, and experienced Google Search user. As far as CS is concerned, my interests lie primarily in the field of High-Performance Computing, Computer Graphics, and Image Processing.
On top of that, I also tend to enjoy doing some full-stack programming.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing around with Blender, which I first picked up around 10 years ago. Every once in a while, I post some renders on my Artstation, so if you are curious check it out below.

## Project Highlight

Have a look at my latest project: [NITRO](https://github.com/BugelNiels/nitro). Nitro is a visual graph-based node editor for building image processing routines and was built to be easily extendable.
