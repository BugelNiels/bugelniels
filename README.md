### Hello internet ðŸ‘‹

I am a computing scientist, book enjoyer, and experienced Google Search user. As far as CS is concerned, my interests lie primarily in the fields of software design, automation, and computer graphics.
I work mainly with C++ and Python but have done projects in numerous other languages and with various technologies/frameworks. Just like I enjoy a clean and organised house (up to a reasonable limit, of course), I also like clean, organised, and maintainable code. As a result, I always try to spend some effort refactoring and cleaning up projects that I actively work on. Technical debt is never fun :)

Sadly I don't have too much time these days to work on projects due to my job, but if you are curious feel free to check out my projects. The most interesting one is probably [NITRO](https://github.com/BugelNiels/nitro). Nitro is a visual graph-based node editor for building image processing routines and was built to be easily extendable.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing around with Blender, which I first picked up around 10 years ago. Occasionally, I post some renders on my Artstation, so if you are curious, check it out below.
