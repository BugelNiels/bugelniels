### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Niels and I am a computing scientist, book enjoyer, and experienced Google Search user. As far as CS is concerned, my interests lie primarily in the field of Computer Graphics and 3D Rendering.
I am also an avid user of Blender, which I first picked up around 10 years ago. Since then, I've always been fascinated with generating realistic renders.
If you are curious, check out my Artstation below. Whenever my free time allows, I try and post some renders there.

## Project Highlight

Have a look at my latest project: [NITRO](https://github.com/BugelNiels/nitro). Nitro is a visual graph-based node editor for building image processing routines and was built to be easily extendable.
