### Hello internet ðŸ‘‹

I am a computing scientist, book enjoyer, and experienced Google Search user. As far as CS is concerned, my interests lie primarily in the fields of High-Performance Computing, Computer Graphics, and Image Processing.
Mainly I work with C++, but I have done projects in numerous languages and with various frameworks. Just like I enjoy a clean and organised house (up to a reasonable limit of course), I also like clean and organised software. As a result, I always try and spend some effort refactoring and cleaning up projects that I actively work on. Clean code bases are way more maintainable, easier to understand and generally a lot more fun to work with.

Sadly I don't have too much time these days to work on projects due to my job, but if you are curious feel free to check out my projects. The most interesting one is probably [NITRO](https://github.com/BugelNiels/nitro). Nitro is a visual graph-based node editor for building image processing routines and was built to be easily extendable. Once I have a bit more time on my hands, I hope to extend and improve this project further.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing around with Blender, which I first picked up around 10 years ago. Occasionally, I post some renders on my Artstation, so if you are curious, check it out below.
